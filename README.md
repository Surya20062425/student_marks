# student_marsk

and we have taken the user input by "input()"
and entered the student name there by cheking the name by "if " we have checked the marks
printed the marks of the student with "print()"

#list_slicing
in list slicing we have created a list called list 
and inserted the numbers 1 to 9 in it 
we are taking th starting,ending of the new list to print by "input()"
in the case of displaying we have used "f" string for simplicity 
we have given the "list[begining:end]" command in "print" to print thelist in that order
for revrse the list we have applied the logic list[::-1]
